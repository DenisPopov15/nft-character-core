const mockedStory = ' Well, let me tell you the story of Woman #1. She was a young woman living in a world of vibrant color, where the sky was a bright pink pastel and the sun shone with a light warm yellow hue. She had unique yellow eyes, a face that glowed like a sunset and a bob-style haircut. She wore a futuristic dress, had red round sunglasses perched on her nose, and her ears were adorned with lightning bolts. Her lips were a passionate red and her mouth was slightly open in anticipation of something new. She was a woman who was always looking for adventure and was ready to take on the world!'
